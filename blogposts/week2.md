## Introduction
For this week we actually wanted to analyze the outcome of the last federal
election. But we noticed that the evolution of the manifestos over the time is
much more important for our long term goal. It also shows a clearer picture over
all the data we gathered. That is why focused on visualisations and analysis of
the manifestos over time. 

## What we have done:
In this section we want to present our first visualisations ideas and approaches.

### Elections Results
We start with an easy overview of the election results of all past federal elections:

#### 1. Elections over time

Here you can see that the traditional "Volksparteien" loses more votes over time in general.
This plot also shows that the "Volksparteien" loses uncommonly more votes whenever a new party has been established.

## Learnings
We identified two major kinds of visualisations.
The first one is visualisations that shows differences between two manifestos, years or parties.
The other one shows a broader view over the data.  

When interactivity is introduced into the visualisations which just shows differences between parties, manifestos or years,
it also could transport information in a broader way.

## What's next
In this week we present simple visualisations which communicate only one or few information in a static way.
In the coming week we would like to explore more with interactive visualisations.
